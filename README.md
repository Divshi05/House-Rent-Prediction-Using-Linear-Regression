**🏠 Housing Rent Price Prediction Using Linear Regression**

**📌 Overview**
This project focuses on predicting housing rent prices using Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. By leveraging a clean and well-structured dataset, the model learns to estimate rent prices based on multiple housing features such as location, size, furnishing status, and more.

**📊 Problem Statement**
Rent prices fluctuate due to various factors, making it challenging for tenants and property managers to make informed decisions. This project aims to build a predictive model that helps users:

Anticipate fair rent costs

Identify over- or underpriced properties

Support data-driven decision-making in the real estate domain

**🚀 Project Pipeline**
Data Collection
Sourced a publicly available housing rent dataset.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Converted categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized correlations

Identified key influencing factors

Model Building
Implemented Linear Regression using scikit-learn, trained and validated the model.

Model Evaluation

Performance measured using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

Residual analysis for model validation

**📈 Results**
The Linear Regression model achieved a [insert accuracy or R² score]% accuracy in predicting rent prices. Detailed feature importance and EDA visualizations are included in the project notebook.

**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

**📄 Conclusion & Insights**
Summarized key takeaways from the model's performance and its practical implications for rental price prediction.
